# go_pia

go_pia is intended to be used in a docker container running transmission connected to a Private Internet Access wireguard vpn.

Its probably easier to use the piactl tool, but I wanted to practice my golang skillz

TODO:

- Work on proper error handling
- Integrate transmission-daemon and port forwarding
- Shift to config.json instead of ENVARS
